# QSAR_classification

###Introduction

The data is from [UCI machine learning repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation)

It has 1,055 instances (molecules) and their 41 features (chemical and physical properties).
Each molecule is either readily biodegradable (RB) or not readily biodegradable (NRB).
Logistic regression, logistic with lasso, logistic with ridge, radial SVM, 
and random forests are used here to classify each molecule as RB or NRB based on 
its 41 features.
